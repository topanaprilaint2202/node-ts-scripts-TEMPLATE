- **Preconfigured ESLint and Prettier**: Maintain code quality and consistency with minimal effort.
- **Yarn Scripts**: Easily run, build, lint, and format your project using simple commands.
- **Batteries Included**: Start coding immediately without the hassle of setup.

## Getting Started

To get started with this template, clone the repository and install the dependencies. 

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14.x or higher)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (optional, but recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/topanaprilaint2202/node-ts-scripts-TEMPLATE.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd node-ts-scripts-TEMPLATE
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

## Usage

You can start using this template right away. Hereâ€™s how to run your first script:

1. Create a new TypeScript file in the `src` directory. For example, create `hello.ts`:

   ```typescript
   console.log("Hello, World!");
   ```

2. Run your script using ts-node:

   ```bash
   yarn run start hello.ts
   ```

## Scripts

The template comes with several useful scripts. Here are the most important ones:

- **Run**: Executes your TypeScript scripts.
  
  ```bash
  yarn run start <script>
  ```

- **Build**: Compiles TypeScript files to JavaScript.
  
  ```bash
  yarn run build
  ```

- **Lint**: Checks your code for issues using ESLint.
  
  ```bash
  yarn run lint
  ```

- **Format**: Formats your code using Prettier.
  
  ```bash
  yarn run format
  ```

## Linting and Formatting

This template uses ESLint and Prettier for linting and formatting your code. To ensure your code meets the standards, run the lint and format scripts regularly.

### ESLint

ESLint helps identify and fix problems in your JavaScript code. You can customize the rules in the `.eslintrc.js` file.

### Prettier

Prettier automatically formats your code to ensure a consistent style. You can configure it in the `.prettierrc` file.
